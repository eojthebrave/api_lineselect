Note: This is still a work in process.

@TODO:
- Add support for multiple code blocks on the same page.

This module ads line numbers to the PHP code displayed by Drupal's API module.

Line numbers can be clicked to highlight the corresponding line. Multiple lines can be highlighted by holding down the Shift key.

You can also link to an API documentation page and automatically highlight line numbers by adding #L1 or #L1-[2,3, ... n] to the URL of the page. For example http://example.com/function_name#L22-28 would highlight lines 22 thru 28.
